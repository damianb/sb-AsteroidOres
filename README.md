# sb-AsteroidOres

AsteroidOres is a simple example Starbound mod demonstrating the use of [sb-buildpak](https://github.com/damianb/sb-buildpak) and [sb-buildpatches](https://github.com/damianb/sb-buildpatches). for use in a Windows-based build system.

## why?

All it really does is add some higher tier ores to asteroid fields for easy mining - what's important is how it's done.

My hope is that by allowing mod developers to modify a copy of the original Starbound asset files, it will allow quicker, easier mod development and get developers to spend less time focusing on the niceties of the JSON patch specification and let them spend more time on adding content to their mods.
